Pet Shelter
===================================

Pet Shelter is an Android app that stores pet information for adoptions using a SQLite database. This app displays a list of pets and their related data that the user inputs. The project is a part of an online course (Android Basics) I took on Udacity https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud845, and some starter code was provided by the course.
